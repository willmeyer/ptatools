### What's Here? ###

This is the app I built for my son's elementary school to manage their sign-in/out sheets electronically on ipads.  It consists of:

* A web app optimized for use on an iPad interface specifically, via a Home Screen bookmark.  The idea is you have an iPad on the desk and thats what visitors use.
* A web app for use by front-desk employees in their desktop browsers to see who has signed in and out, search, etc.

The visitor interface:

The front-desk interface:

### Using It ###

For my own use, you bet.  Its web-based, HTML5/JS in PHP, and should be able to run anywhere you can host PHP and get to a Mongo database (I use [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) and [MongoHQ]{http://www.mongohq.com).
	
In theory, its usable by others, though the branding is specific to my son's school and there's not anything like the kind of pluggable interface you'd want there.  

If you feel like using it as a starting point, though, feel free.  The only thing you really need to do to get something basic working, once you have a Mongo DB created, is edit config.inc.php for your deployment. 

I also need to set up a demo...
